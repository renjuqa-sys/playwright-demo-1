## Testing guidelines

- **Tag tests intentionally**: Always tag tests with the appropriate `TAGS` (e.g. `SMOKE`, `REGRESSION`, `AUTH`) so they participate correctly in filtered runs.
- **Respect auth projects**: Member/admin tests should rely on the auth setup projects and `.auth/*.json` storage state files rather than re-logging in inline.
- **Keep tests focused**: Single test should validate one coherent behaviour (e.g. "add item to cart" or "contact header visible"), delegating UI details to page objects.
- **Isolation**: Each test must be independent. Use fixtures for setup instead of large `beforeEach` hooks when possible.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Page Objects handle "How" (locators/actions). Tests handle "What" (assertions). Keep `expect()` inside `.test` files only.
