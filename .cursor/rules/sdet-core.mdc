# Playwright SDET Gold Standard Rules

## Project overview & features

- **Playwright multi-project setup**: `playwright.config.ts` defines projects for web and mobile, with dedicated smoke and regression suites plus role-based admin projects.
- **Tagged test strategy**: Central `TAGS` constants (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@auth`, priorities, etc.) drive `grep`/`grepInvert` filters in Playwright projects.
- **Auth setup & teardown flow**: `validate-env` → web/mobile auth setup (`auth.setup.ts`) → tests → web/mobile teardown (`auth.teardown.ts` and `global.teardown.ts`).
- **Role-based authentication**: `user-manager` and `USER_ROLES` manage admin vs customer credentials and generate per-worker `.auth/*.json` storage states.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Web pages live under `src/pages/web`, extend `BasePage`, and centralise navigation and shared UI components.
- **Composable traits for pages**: `compose` helper and `WithToaster` trait add cross-cutting behaviour like toaster verification to page objects.
- **Route & tag constants**: `ROUTES` and `TAGS` centralise URL paths and tag names for consistent usage across tests and config.
- **User role constants**: `USER_ROLES` and `UserRole` give a single source of truth for supported user roles.
- **Custom fixtures layer**: `src/fixtures/baseTest.ts` wraps Playwright's `test` with fixtures for page objects, routes, tags, and translations.
- **Reporting & quality tooling**: Allure + HTML reporters, ESLint, Prettier, type-checking, Husky and lint-staged are wired via `package.json` scripts.
- **DRY**: If a locator or method exists in a Page Object, reuse it. Do not duplicate logic.

## General conventions

- **Keep using the Page Object Model**: New UI interactions should go into page objects under `src/pages`, not directly in tests.
- **Extend `BasePage` for web pages**: New web pages should extend `BasePage` (or composed variants) to inherit navigation and shared components like `NavigationBar`.
- **Use getter-style locators**: Expose locators via `private get` accessors (or small helper methods when parameters are required), never as eagerly-evaluated fields.
- **Prefer `data-test` selectors**: When adding new UI, include stable `data-test` attributes and target them via `page.getByTestId(...)`.
- **Use `test.step` for actions**: Wrap meaningful user flows (login, add to cart, etc.) in `test.step` blocks for readable reports.
- **Reuse fixtures**: When writing tests, consume page objects and helpers from `@fixtures/baseTest` instead of instantiating Playwright `Page` or locators manually.
- **JSDOC**: JSDoc on all methods
- Use `test.step('Description', async () => { ... })` for every major action.
- Assertions (`expect`) belong in `.spec.ts` files, NOT in Page Objects.
- Use Playwright **Fixtures** for setup instead of `beforeEach` hooks.
- **Fixtures**: Use the custom `@fixtures/baseTest` layer. Do not manually instantiate Page Objects using `new`.
